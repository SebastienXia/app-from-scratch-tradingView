## Variables
There are two types of variables, **val** and **var** :
| Type | Description | Example |
|-------|-----|------|
| val | `val`, a variable type which, like `final` in Java, is immutable and therefore cannot be modified after it has been given its first value. | val id = "123@idsecret" |
| var | `var` is the type of variable called mutable, which can be modified. | var fruit = "Apple" |
